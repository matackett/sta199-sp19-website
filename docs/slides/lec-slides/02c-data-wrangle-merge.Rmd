# Data Wrangling

---

## Bike crashes in NC 2007 - 2014

The dataset is in the **dsbox** package:

```{r load-data, eval=FALSE}
library(dsbox)
ncbikecrash
```

- The dataset contains all North Carolina bike crash data from 2007-2014. 
- Data downloaded on Sep 6, 2018.

### A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

.pull-left[
![](img/02b/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- `arrange`: reorder rows
]

### A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

.pull-left[
![](img/02b/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- ... (many more)
]

---

## **dplyr** rules for functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame

- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

- Always return a data frame

- Don't modify in place

---

### `filter` to select rows

- **One condition**
    - for crashes in Durham County

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham") 
```

--

- **Many conditions**
    - for crashes in Durham County where biker was 0-5 years old

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham", bike_age_group == "0-5")
```

---

### `select` to select or exclude variables

- select variables (columns)

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham", bike_age_group == "0-5") %>%
  select(locality, speed_limit)
```

--

- exclude variables 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(-object_id)
```

--

- range of variables 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(city:locality)
```

---

### `slice` for certain row numbers

- First five

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

--

- Last five

```{r eval=FALSE}
last_row <- nrow(ncbikecrash)
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row)
```

---

### `pull` to extract a column as a vector

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  pull(locality)
```
]

vs.

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  select(locality)
```
]

---

### `sample_n` / `sample_frac` for a random sample

- `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash_n5 <- ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)
dim(ncbikecrash_n5)
```
]

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash_perc20 <-ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE)
dim(ncbikecrash_perc20)
```
]
---

### `distinct` to filter for unique rows

And `arrange` to order alphabetically

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  select(county, city) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(county, city)
```

---

### `summarise` to reduce variables to values

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour))
```

---

### `group_by` to do calculations on groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  group_by(hit_run) %>%
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour))
```

---

### `count` observations in groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs)
```

---

### `mutate` to add new variables

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    driver_alcohol_drugs == "Missing"       ~ NA,
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ "No"
  ))
```
]
---

### "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame.

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash <- ncbikecrash %>%
  mutate(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified = case_when(
    str_detect(driver_alcohol_drugs, "Yes") ~ "Yes",
    TRUE                                    ~ driver_alcohol_drugs
  ))
```
]
---

### Check before you move on

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs, driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified)
```
]

.small[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs_simplified)
```
]

## AE 04 - NC bike crashes

- Copy the NC Bike Crashes project on RStudio Cloud

- For each question you work on, set the `eval` chunk option to `TRUE` and knit

## Merge Conflicts

class: middle, center

## What is a merge conflict?

---

## Merge conflicts

When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, 
git merges these two files.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-no-conflict.png")
```

--

If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a <font class="vocab">merge conflict</font>.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-conflict.png")
```

---

## Resolving merge conflicts

- Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-conflict-identifiers.png")
```

- To resolve the merge conflict
  - decide if you want to keep only your text or the text on GitHub or 
  incorporate changes from both texts
  - delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the 
  changes you want in the final merge

# Application exercise

---

## AE 05 - Merge Conflicts 

**Sit with your team**

**Once you're with your team:**

- Clone your assignment repo in RStudio Cloud (`ae-05-merge-conflicts-TEAMNAME`), 
and open the R Markdown file.

- Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members.
    - If you have 3 team members, make one person **Member 2** and **Member 4**.

- Follow the [application exercise instructions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta199.001/appex/02c-merge-conflicts.html) exactly.

## Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.
- Commit, and push, often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.
- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.
