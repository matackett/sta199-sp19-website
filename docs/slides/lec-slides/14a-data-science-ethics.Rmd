### Alternate ways to evaluate evidence

- Concentrate on effect sizes (how big of a difference does an intervention make, and is it practically meaningful?)

- Use confidence intervals to estimate effect size

--

- Ask whether the result from a novel study or a replication (put some more weight into a theory many labs have looked into)

--

- Ask whether underlying data is freely accessible (so anyone can check the math)

--

- Use alternative statistical techniques like likelihood ratios and Bayes factors
    - P-values ask the question “how rare are my results?” 
    - Likelhood ratios and Bayes factors ask the question “what is the probability my hypothesis is the best explanation for the results we found?”

## Privacy

## OK Cupid Data Breach

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users—including usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details.

>Some may object to the ethics of gathering and releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it in a more useful form.
Researchers Emil Kirkegaard and Julius Daugbjerg Bjerrekær

- Although the researchers did not release the real names and pictures of the OkCupid users, critics noted that their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided—such as from the usernames.

### Amazon's Experimental Hiring Algorithm

- Amazon used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said

- Company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way

- Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable

>Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. Source

Predictive Policing: Bias In, Bias Out

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically

- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
